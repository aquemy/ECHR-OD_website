                    <p>The database and datasets are based on the raw documents and information available publicly in the <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int" title="HUDOC Database">HUDOC</a> database. The process is broken down into several steps as illustrated by the following workflow:
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>get_cases_info.py</strong>: Retrieve the list and basic information about cases from HUDOC</li>
                          <li><strong>filter_cases.py</strong>: Remove unwanted, inconsistant, ambiguous or difficult-to-process cases</li>
                          <li><strong>preprocess_documents.py</strong>: Analyse the raw judgments to construct a JSON nested structures representing the paragraphs</li>
                          <li><strong>process_documents.py</strong>: Normalize the documents and generate a Bag-of-Words and TFID representation</li>
                          <li><strong>generate_datasets.py</strong>: Combine all the information to generate several datasets</li>
                        </ul>
